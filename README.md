# SentimentAl
My final project for LIS4370 where I had to make my own R package
Simplifies text data preprocessing and sentiment analysis for fellow data analysts to help improve workflow efficiency.
Examples:

calculate_avg_word_length("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.")
sentiment_analysis("Hello how are you I'm doing great thanks love")
text_classification("I love playing video games! The alternative I dislike are textbooks, they are boring.")
text_preprocessing("I love building plastic model kits")
